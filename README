TESTING
=======

Ironout tests are located in ``tests`` folder.  Running ``make test`` will
build ``tests/runtests``.  It can be used like::

  $ tests/runtests tests

``runtests`` takes the directory which contains test files.  The name
of each test file starts with ``test-``.

The format of this file is like::

  [SEP] COMMAND ARGS
  COMMAND_BLOCK
  [SEP] NEXT_COMMAND ARGS
  COMMAND_BLOCK
  ...

Where ``SEP`` is a string that does not contain spaces; it is used to
find where commands start and end.  ``COMMAND`` shows what to do; they
are listed in the following table:

=========  ======  =================================================
